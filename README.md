# MITS_PROJECT--Landing-Page
I have created a Landing page for Micro Information Technology Services

This project is a modern, responsive landing page built for Micro Information Technology Services (MITS). It highlights the organization's mission to bridge students with real-world tech opportunities through collaboration with top universities like IITs and NITs. The webpage features student affiliations, social media stats, authentic testimonials, a contact/enquiry form with backend integration (PHP), and embedded newsletter subscription. Designed using Bootstrap 5 and enhanced with custom animations and clean UI principles, this project reflects strong fundamentals in frontend and backend development
